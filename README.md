# Meals DB application using OpenMealsDB and PrimeVue ⚡️

## Project Briefing

This is a simple database application which integrates with an open source Meals database API <a href="https://www.themealdb.com/api.php"> https://www.themealdb.com/api.php </a> which I found recently. I have worked on other APIs created by this organization like CocktailAPI which has been a pleasant experience for me.

I wanted to experiment with the composition API and hooks based approach of API integration in Vue without the use of Vuex. I needed an open API which I can use as data source for this. I read about this open API in one of the blog posts I stumbled across lately and found this API to be apt for this.

As for UI, I try to experiment with different UI frameworks available for Vue. In this case, I went with PrimeVue. I found it relatively easy to get started with, has a wide range of components to offer and a nice color schema.
